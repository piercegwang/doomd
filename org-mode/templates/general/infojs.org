#+INFOJS_OPT: view:overview toc:nil

[[https://orgmode.org/manual/JavaScript-support.html][Javascript Support Org-mode Manual]]

- ~path:~ :: The path to the script. The default is to grab the script from https://orgmode.org/org-info.js, but you might want to have a local copy and use a path like ~../scripts/org-info.js~.

- ~view:~ :: Initial view when the website is first shown. Possible values are:

  - ~info~ :: Info-like interface with one section per page
  - ~overview~ :: Folding interface, initially showing only top-level
  - ~content~ :: Folding interface, starting with all headlines visible
  - ~showall~ :: Folding interface, all headlines and text visible

- ~sdepth:~ :: Maximum headline level still considered as an independent section for info and folding modes. The default is taken from org-export-headline-levels, i.e., the ~H’ switch in ‘OPTIONS~. If this is smaller than in org-export-headline-levels, each info/folding section can still contain child headlines.

- ~toc:~ :: Should the table of contents initially be visible? Even when ~nil~, you can always get to the “toc” with i.

- ~tdepth:~ :: The depth of the table of contents. The defaults are taken from the variables org-export-headline-levels and org-export-with-toc.

- ~ftoc:~ :: Does the CSS of the page specify a fixed position for the “toc”? If yes, the toc is displayed as a section.

- ~ltoc:~ :: Should there be short contents (children) in each section? Make this ~above~ if the section should be above initial text.

- ~mouse:~ :: Headings are highlighted when the mouse is over them. Should be ~underline’ (default) or a background color like ‘#cccccc~.

- ~buttons:~ :: Should view-toggle buttons be everywhere? When ~nil~ (the default), only one such button is present.
